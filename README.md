## Getting Started

[Getting Started/Preparation](https://hiroppy.github.io/fusuma/docs/getting-started/preparation)

Node versions > v12

Just execute the following two lines for executing, generating and deploying slides!

```shell
$ npm i fusuma -D
# not mandatory but it's one easy method
$ npx fusuma init
$ tree -a
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .fusumarc.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ slides
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 0-title.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css

$ npx fusuma start # let's start writing slides!

# --- executable tasks---
$ npx fusuma init          # create scaffold
$ npx fusuma start         # run server for development
$ npx fusuma start-prod    # run server for bundle directory
$ npx fusuma build         # build slides for production
$ npx fusuma deploy        # deploy to github pages
$ npx fusuma pdf           # export as PDF
$ npx fusuma live          # start live mode
```

When `npx fusuma start` is executed, fusuma will create a slide as follows and serve `http://localhost:8080` and then you can write slides with HMR.

Fusuma adds a Sidebar like below. When you set section titles, fusuma shows them on here.

When you set the URL of the deployment destination at the production stage, fusuma generate og:image using a first slide automatically.
